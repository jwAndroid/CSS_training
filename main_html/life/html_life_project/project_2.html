        <p>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, <br>
            including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,<br>
            provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, <br>
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .<br>
            css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content <br>
            as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between <br>
            the pages that share the file and its formatting.
